                    <section id="contract-verification">
                        <h2>Automatic Contract Verification</h2>
                        <p>At CannaMint, we prioritize transparency and trust in the token creation process. One of the key features we offer is automatic contract verification on Basescan for all tokens launched through our platform.</p>
                        <h3>What is Contract Verification?</h3>
                        <p>Contract verification is the process of publishing your smart contract&apos;s source code on the blockchain explorer (in this case, Basescan). This allows anyone to review the code, ensuring transparency and building trust in your project.</p>
                        <h3>CannaMint&apos;s Automatic Verification</h3>
                        <p>When you create a token using CannaMint, we handle the verification process for you:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Your contract is automatically submitted to Basescan for verification.</li>
                            <li>The source code becomes publicly visible and verifiable on Basescan.</li>
                            <li>No additional steps are required from you - it&apos;s all done seamlessly.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Benefits of Automatic Verification</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Transparency</strong>: Investors and users can easily verify your token&apos;s functionality.</li>
                            <li><strong>Credibility</strong>: Verified contracts are seen as more trustworthy in the crypto community.</li>
                            <li><strong>Time-saving</strong>: You don&apos;t need to go through the manual verification process.</li>
                            <li><strong>Error-free</strong>: Eliminates the risk of mistakes in the verification process.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>By choosing CannaMint for your Base ERC-20 token launch, you&apos;re ensuring that your project starts on the right foot with a verified, transparent smart contract.

                        <h2>CannaMint&apos;s 1% Supply Fee</h2>
                        <p>At CannaMint, we believe in creating a sustainable ecosystem that benefits both new token launches and our existing community. To achieve this, we implement a 1% supply fee on all tokens launched through our platform. Here&apos;s how it works and why it&apos;s beneficial for everyone involved:</p>
                        <h3>How It Works</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>When you launch a new Base ERC-20 token using CannaMint, we collect a 1% supply fee from the total token supply.</li>
                            <li>Half of this collected fee (0.5% of the total supply) is airdropped to holders of Based THC, the token that powers the CannaMint ecosystem.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h3>Benefits</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Exposure and Marketing</strong>: By distributing your tokens to Based THC holders, your new project gains immediate exposure to an active and engaged community of crypto enthusiasts. This serves as free marketing for your token launch.</li>
                            <li><strong>Instant Holder Base</strong>: The airdrop creates an initial holder base for your token, potentially increasing its visibility and trading volume from the start.</li>
                            <li><strong>Community Support</strong>: Based THC holders become natural allies for your project, as they now have a stake in your token&apos;s success.</li>
                            <li><strong>Ecosystem Strength</strong>: The fee mechanism strengthens the entire CannaMint ecosystem, ensuring the platform&apos;s continued development and improvement, which in turn benefits all tokens launched through it.</li>
                            <li><strong>Incentivized Holding</strong>: This mechanism incentivizes holding Based THC, creating a more stable and engaged user base for the CannaMint platform.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Powered by Based THC</h3>
                        <p>CannaMint is powered by Based THC, our native token. By holding Based THC, users not only support the CannaMint platform but also gain exposure to a diverse portfolio of new token launches on the Base network.</p>
                        <p>This innovative fee structure creates a win-win situation: new token launches benefit from immediate exposure and a built-in holder base, while Based THC holders are rewarded with a constant stream of new tokens, aligning the interests of all participants in the CannaMint ecosystem.</p>
